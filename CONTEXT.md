# Yomu

On-device manga translation for Android. A page is captured on manual trigger, its speech bubbles are detected and read, and the text is translated locally without leaving the device.

## Language

### Models

**Curated model**:
A model Yomu selects, hosts a download URL for, and supports. The only kind of model allowed in the detection and OCR slots, and the shipped default in the translation slot.
_Avoid_: bundled model, official model, default model

**Custom model**:
A GGUF the user supplies from their own storage for the translation slot, alongside its curated default. Permitted but explicitly unsupported, and labelled as such wherever its output appears.
_Avoid_: sideloaded model, user model, BYO model, third-party model

**Deliverable**:
One model at one quantization — the unit the curated catalog lists, gates on device fit, and downloads. Two quantizations of the same model are two deliverables, each with its own size, checksum and licence.
_Avoid_: model variant, build, quant entry, artefact

**Experimental deliverable**:
A curated [[deliverable]] added on desk research and not yet confirmed on the reference phone, shown with an Experimental tag so the reader knows Yomu has not tested it. A temporary state with three exits — confirmed, switched to per-line, or removed (ADR-0017); the default is never experimental.
_Avoid_: beta model, preview model, untested model

**Fit budget**:
The RAM a deliverable must fit inside to be offered on a given device — its file size plus a fixed resident-overhead estimate, against a fraction of the device's total memory. Estimated from measurement, never from parsing a file Yomu has not downloaded.
_Avoid_: RAM gate, memory limit, device tier

**Model family**:
The set of deliverables that are the same model at different quantizations. Grouped only so device fit can offer the largest one that fits; a family is never itself selectable.
_Avoid_: quant matrix, model group, variant set

**Translation slot**:
The selected component that accepts one geometry-free page and owns every model-specific translation decision. Exactly one LLM deliverable fills it at a time; there is no non-LLM translator (ADR-0016).
_Avoid_: translation bridge, selected engine wrapper, translation engine

### Translation context

**Panel**:
A group of bubbles inferred to belong to the same comic frame. Used to order bubbles and to mark grouping inside the page prompt — never to split a page into multiple model calls.
_Avoid_: conversation block, chunk, frame

**Session context** (withdrawn):
The previous page's source/translation pairs, carried into the next page's prompt so pronouns, names, and register stay consistent across a reading session. ADR-0013 withdrew it on measurement — the production-shaped payload overflowed the prompt cap on 4 of 17 pages and no arm showed a quality gain — and the plumbing is deleted, not dormant. The term is kept here because the ADRs that decided and undid it still use it; nothing in the code does.
_Avoid_: history, memory, conversation history

## Visual system

**Chrome**:
The app's own managed screens — Home, History, Settings — rendered in Compose. The surface the paper-mâché visual system governs.
_Avoid_: main UI, app screens, the app

**Overlay control**:
An interactive element drawn over live manga to operate translation — floating button, quick-settings popup, close zone, status toast. Governed by the paper-mâché visual system, but its legibility over arbitrary artwork is a constraint, not a cosmetic choice.
_Avoid_: overlay UI, HUD, widget

**Typeset bubble**:
The translated text laid into a bubble over the live page, coloured for legibility against the artwork underneath (today dark ink on a light fill). Outside the visual system: its appearance answers to readability, never to the paper aesthetic.
_Avoid_: translation overlay, rendered bubble, text box

**Paper surface**:
A visual layer in the [[chrome]] evoking cut or layered paper through warm colour, shape, border and offset shadow — never a photographic paper texture. The building block of the paper-mâché language.
_Avoid_: card, panel, texture
