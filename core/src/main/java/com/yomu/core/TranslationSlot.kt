 * private constant in `LlamaTranslationBridge`. ADR-0008 spent a whole cycle blaming model
 * quality for what turned out to be an undocumented `MAX_TOKENS = 64` in that constant pile, so
 * each default below records where its value came from. #139 declined a further ADR on the
 * grounds that this comment is the deliverable that prevents the repeat.
 *
 * Defaults are byte-identical to the behaviour that shipped before they moved here. Changing one
 * is a measurement, not a refactor: #137 owns the control row every candidate value is scored
 * against.
 *
 * There is deliberately no per-model override. Two models get different parameters only when a
 * measurement forces them apart.
